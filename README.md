# Boilerplate for Express and PostgreSQL Integration with Prisma and Docker
A boilerplate for building scalable and maintainable Express.js applications using TypeScript, Prisma ORM, and Docker. It is designed to streamline the development process by offering a pre-configured setup that integrates these technologies seamlessly. This repository provides a boilerplate for building a backend API using express and CRUD operations with PostgreSQL as the database.

## Features

- **TypeScript Support**: Leverage TypeScript's static typing for enhanced code quality and developer experience.
- **Express Setup**: Pre-configured with Express for rapid API development.
- **Environment Configuration**: Easily manage environment variables using [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).
- **ESLint**: Pre-configured for consistent code style and linting.
- **Jest**: Ready-to-go setup for unit and integration testing.
- **Swagger UI**: Auto-generated API documentation using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).
- **PostgreSQL**: Pre-configured with PostgreSQL for database integration.
- **Prisma**: Pre-configured with Prisma for database integration.
- **Docker**: Pre-configured with Docker for easy deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (>= 18.x recommended)
- **Yarn** or **npm**

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rochiyat/express-typescript-prisma-docker-boilerplate.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd express-typescript-prisma-docker-boilerplate

# Install dependencies
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

### Seeding the Database

Seeding with the `seed` script will populate the database with sample data library *static-mock-data-seeder*.
Can you see in repo https://github.com/rochiyat/postgres-mock-seeder
Make sure to install it before running the seed script & application connect to the database.
```bash
# Create the tables
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Run the seed script
yarn seed
# or
npm run seed
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the development server without docker
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

```bash
# Start the production server with docker
yarn docker:dev
# or
npm run docker:dev
```

The server will start on **http://localhost:3000** by default.

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the production version without docker
yarn build
# or
npm run build
```

```bash
# Build the production version with docker
yarn docker:prod
# or
npm run docker:prod
```

This will compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript under the `dist` directory.

### Running Tests & Coverage

```bash
yarn test
yarn test:coverage
# or
npm test
npm test:coverage
```

## Configuration

Environment variables are managed using a `.env`, `.env.dev`, and `.env.prod` file. Here's an env.example:

```
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

DEV_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
PROD_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"

DATABASE_URL=${DEV_DATABASE_URL}

```
